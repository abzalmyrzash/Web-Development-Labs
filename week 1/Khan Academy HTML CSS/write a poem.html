        <p>
            Somebody once told me<br>
            The world is gonna roll me<br>
            I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
            She was looking kind of dumb<br>
            With her finger and her thumb<br>
            In the shape of an 'L' on her forehead<br>
        </p>
